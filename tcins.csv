Its rotating seat always allows complete access to the baby while the independently adjustable back and footrests (3 positions each) provide optimal ergonomic position and comfort for the baby. Differently from traditionally voice-activated swings (sometimes the baby makes happy noises and does not need soothing) Swoon Motion is activated by the shaking motion a baby produces when crying.  Once activated the swinging motion can be programmed to last 10, 20, 30 minutes. Parents can also choose to play one of 8 preprogrammed lullabies or to upload their own music.
